        <p>As a part of Health and Hygiene , we conducted survey on Health and Hygiene. On conducting survey. We noticed that many people are suffering from different health problems. Now a days people are more addicted to street side foods and they are facing more issues on their health. We explained to the people about what problems will they get by eating different types of street foods, and we explained some suggestions to the people and we supplied medicines and face masks to the old age people. </p>
   <p>We continued our survey and gathered information from people on food habits and neatness. We came to know that people are suffering from lack of awareness on Health and Hygiene. We gave explanation to the people about masks used in covid situation. The face mask has become one of the essential accessories as they are used as the most efficient strategy of precautionary measure to curb covid-19 transmission. Last year, many people thought it would be a temporary phase and won't have to wear face masks after things get better. But little did they know that they will have to wear masks as they wear clothes every day. Face masks have undeniably become a necessity, and maintaining the hygiene of the face masks has also become equally important for health. We conducted awareness.  </p>
