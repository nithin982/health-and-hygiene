            <h2>Face Masks and Covid-19</h2>
            <p>The face mask has become one of the essential accessories as they are used as the most efficient strategy of precautionary measure to curb covid-19 transmission. Last year, many people thought it would be a temporary phase and won't have to wear face masks after things get better. But little did they know that they will have to wear masks as they wear clothes every day. Face masks have undoubtedly become a necessity, and maintaining the hygiene of the face masks has also become equally important for health.</p>
            <p>Face masks came into the limelight when the world started to experience the eruption of Coronavirus. Covid-19 has become a commonly spread virus between people in close contact without maintaining adequate social distancing. It is known that covid-19 spreads through respiratory droplets or small particles released when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. Therefore tailor-made masks for covid-19 started to float in the market ever since the virus has come into existence.</p>
