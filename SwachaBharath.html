    <h1>Swachh Bharat: Health and Hygiene</h1>
    <p>The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched by the Indian government on October 2, 2014, is a landmark initiative aimed at creating a cleaner, healthier, and more hygienic India. This campaign not only focuses on sanitation and cleanliness but also emphasizes the direct link between cleanliness and health. By fostering a culture of cleanliness, Swachh Bharat aims to improve the overall quality of life and public health in the country.</p>
    
    <h2>The Importance of Cleanliness</h2>
    <p>Cleanliness is fundamental to health and hygiene. A clean environment reduces the risk of diseases, especially those caused by poor sanitation and contaminated water. Proper waste management, clean streets, and access to clean water are critical components of a healthy society. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan recognizes this and strives to address these issues comprehensively.</p>
