Eating fruits is highly beneficial for health and hygiene. Fruits are rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that boost the immune system, improve digestion, and support overall well-being. Key points include:
	<p><strong>Nutrient-Rich:</strong> Fruits provide vital nutrients like vitamin C, potassium, and dietary fiber.</p>
	<p><strong>Hydration:</strong> High water content in fruits helps maintain hydration.</p>
	<p><strong>Disease Prevention:</strong> Antioxidants in fruits reduce the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.</p>
	<p><strong>Digestive Health: </strong>Fiber in fruits promotes healthy digestion and prevents constipation.</p>
	<p><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Low in calories and high in fiber, fruits can aid in weight control.</p>
	<p><strong>Skin Health: </strong>Vitamins and antioxidants in fruits contribute to healthy skin.</p>
For hygiene, it is crucial to wash fruits thoroughly before consumption to remove pesticides, bacteria, and other contaminants. Organic fruits may have fewer chemicals, but washing is still essential to ensure they are safe to eat
