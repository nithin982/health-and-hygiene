    <h1>WEEK-4 REPORT</h1>
    <div class="report">
        <p><span class="date">DATE:</span> 3-06-2024 to 08-06-2024</p>
        <p>At a dissemination workshop organised by WHO Country for India, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, key findings of an assessment undertaken by WHO to study the health gains from the progress made under the Government of Indiaâ€™s Swachh Bharat (Clean India) Mission were presented.</p>
        <p>The study presents initial estimates of the expected health gains from reduced diarrhoeal disease and malnutrition due to increased sanitation coverage following the Swachh Bharat initiative and was undertaken at the request of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. The Swachh Bharat Mission marks a paradigm shift in India's approach to sanitation. It goes beyond the traditional understanding of sanitation as merely the construction of toilets and encompasses a holistic perspective that includes behaviour change, waste management, and awareness creation. .</p>
   <p>Maintaining proper sanitation practices is crucial for ensuring public health and well-being. The Swachh Bharat Mission recognizes the significance of sanitation in preventing the spread of diseases, improving hygiene practices, and reducing healthcare burdens. By focusing on sanitation, the mission aims to create a healthier and cleaner environment for all citizens. </p>
